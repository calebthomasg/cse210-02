I think that we can use the encapsulation method mainly in our Director() class.
We can use it on the self._word variable to make sure that the word isn't changed or altered
in that class. We can also use it for the self.score variable so that the score doesn't
change outside of the class. By doing this, we'll make sure that these two variables aren't
accidently altered outside of their respective classes, keeping the data private and secure.
We might also need to do this to the board function depending on whether we decide to keep it a
function or turn it into a class.
